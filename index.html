            <h3>Cost Comparison: Paid 5G Test Benches vs. Open-Source Solutions</h3>
            <p>While commercial services like AWS and Azure provide quick deployment for 5G networks, they come at a high cost. Open-source tools like OpenAirInterface (OAI) and srsRAN, on the other hand, offer a more flexible, cost-effective solution, especially for research and experimental use. Here's a comparison of the costs associated with paid services versus the benefits of open-source platforms:</p>
            
            <table border="1">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Service Name</th>
                        <th>Initial Cost / Fee</th>
                        <th>Key Advantages</th>
                        <th>Why Open-Source is Better</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>AWS Private 5G</td>
                        <td>$14,400 for 60 days</td>
                        <td>Easy to deploy, cloud-based scalability</td>
                        <td>High cost, limited to 4G, future 5G</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Azure Private 5G</td>
                        <td>Variable (fixed throughput pricing)</td>
                        <td>Scalable, secure, and global network management</td>
                        <td>Can be costly at scale; open-source offers flexibility without recurring fees</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>OpenAirInterface (OAI)</td>
                        <td>Free (open-source)</td>
                        <td>Full 4G/5G network stack, community support</td>
                        <td>No upfront costs, highly customizable</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>srsRAN</td>
                        <td>Free (open-source)</td>
                        <td>Lightweight, modular, flexible deployment</td>
                        <td>No costs, fully customizable at scale</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Why Open-Source is More Cost-Effective:</strong> Open-source solutions like OAI and srsRAN are free to use, whereas cloud-based services like AWS and Azure involve ongoing costs based on data usage and network size. Open-source tools allow for greater flexibility in network setups and enable users to scale and experiment without incurring additional charges for each device or data transfer.</p>
