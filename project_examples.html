            <h2>Introduction to Open-Source 4G/5G Network Implementations</h2>
            <p>The development of 4G and 5G networks has transformed global communications, making connectivity faster, more efficient, and increasingly flexible. Traditional mobile network implementations require extensive infrastructure and proprietary hardware, creating significant entry barriers for researchers, developers, and small-scale operators. Open-source 4G/5G solutions, leveraging the flexibility of Software Defined Radio (SDR), provide an accessible, modular alternative that enables users to deploy, test, and innovate on cellular network architectures without large investments.</p>
            <p>In this context, open-source projects like OpenAirInterface (OAI) and srsRAN have become essential tools. These projects provide a complete stack for building and testing LTE and NR (5G) networks, supporting both virtualized and physical environments. They empower users to explore everything from basic LTE deployments to cutting-edge 5G research. This page will guide you through the details of these two popular platforms, outlining the necessary setup, main features, and potential applications of each.</p>
